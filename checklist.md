## HR review

1. To make it clear to the recruiter what exactly this landing page is, it is better to give the whole web page the title “NAMU”
2. A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma
3. Links in the header and footer menus should lead to the corresponding blocks of the landing page
4. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
5. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
6. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
7. The buttons "buy a ticket" and "register" should lead to the block "Plan a visit to the museum"
8. Buttons in the footer of the menu should also be clickable and lead to blocks on the landing page.
9. All the social icons in the footer should be clickable and open the museum's social networks in a new tab
